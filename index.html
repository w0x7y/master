        <h1>The Master Behind the Champion</h1>
        <p>No great warrior rises alone, and Idan Gilboa is no exception. Behind every strike, every perfected
            technique, and every moment of calm in the storm of combat stands the guiding presence of his master: Ohad.

            Ohad was not an ordinary coach. Whispers of his training methods spread like stories told around a
            campfire—half unbelievable, half terrifying. Some said he once sparred against five men at once,
            blindfolded, just to “stay sharp.” Others claimed he could break a watermelon with a single fingertip,
            though he preferred to save such demonstrations for only the most serious of apprentices.

            When Idan first stepped into the gym, Ohad did not see just a boy—he saw potential. A spark waiting to
            ignite into a blaze. He took Idan under his wing, but not with kindness alone. Ohad`s lessons were ruthless,
            designed to test the limits of body and mind:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Dawn Runs:</strong> 5 a.m. sprints up endless hills, with Ohad pacing alongside, sipping
                coffee as if gravity itself didn`t apply to him.</li>
            <li><strong>The Silent Rounds:</strong> sparring sessions where Idan was forbidden to speak, breathe too
                loudly, or even wince, because, as Ohad declared, “Pain is a language. Learn it.”</li>
            <li><strong>The Code of Balance:</strong> training that fused martial arts with puzzles and riddles, forcing
                Idan to solve equations mid-workout, sharpening not only his fists but his mind.</li>
        </ul>
        Through these trials, Idan was forged. Ohad was not merely a master of fighting—he was a craftsman of champions.
        And in Idan, he saw his magnum opus.

        Even outside the gym, Ohad`s eccentric wisdom shaped Idan. He often delivered bizarre but unforgettable advice,
        such as:
        <ul>
            <li>“A true fighter never underestimates his opponent… or his breakfast.”</li>
            <li>“The cage is just a circle. But the circle has no corners. Think about that.”</li>
            <li>“Physics is your ally. Programming is your weapon. Fighting is the space where they meet.”</li>
        </ul>
        It was under this mentorship that Idan Gilboa rose to dominate the Timtam Tournament, not once, not twice, but
        three times, and to remain undefeated into 2025.

        For every cheer of the crowd, for every victory, and for every defense of the title, Ohad`s influence can be
        felt. If Idan is the sword, then Ohad is the blacksmith who forged it.
